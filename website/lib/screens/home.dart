## Judge at Yearly Oral Math Olympiad

[Individual oral math olympiad](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/olympiad/)
is a unique event happening yearly
just in **two places in the world**: Saint Petersburg, Russia
and Seattle, WA.

Unlike other math olympiads, it is **oral**, that means students
have three attempts to explain their solution to a judge, and
receive **feedback**. This allows students to learn
and **improve their skills in real time**.

After the event, **the solutions** for all problems are presented and
**discussed** in a large room.

If you want to become a judge, or **volunteer** differently at the event,
please contact me.

## Hawaii Host

My **second home** is in Hawaii, West Molokai. **Rent it** while I am on big land!

It is **ðŸ”¥ magical**! Find details [here](${AppRoutes.molokai}).
