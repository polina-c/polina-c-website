## Life Mirror

You can schedule a life mirroring session with me.

Sometimes things are **clear**: We know **what we want**
and how to get there.
It is just a matter of time.

Sometimes things are **foggy**: We are lost. Or we feel we could move
faster, with less friction. And we suspect we may have blind spots.

We may want to look at our life in a mirror, to catch details
that we normally do not see.

It is good to have a pool of people (life mirrors?) to whom we can say,
‚ÄúI have ambitious goals. And I am facing challenges achieving them.
I want to **move faster and easier**. Could you please become my mirror,
and help me extend my perspective, so that I could see more?‚Äù

Mirrors may show reality very differently, deepening it,
altering it, twisting it and taking all possible angles.
If we **differentiate reflections
from reality**, the reflections may be **very helpful**,
showing us perspectives and angles that we could not think about.

I am inviting you to add me to your **pool of life mirrors**.
